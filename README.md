PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF IPL 2025

In the modern era of sports, data has become as crucial as technique, strategy, and form. Cricket, a game of glorious uncertainties, has now embraced the digital revolution through detailed analytics and real-time performance tracking. The Indian Premier League (IPL), being the world’s most popular T20 franchise tournament, is at the forefront of this transformation. With each match producing thousands of data points—from ball-by-ball sequences to individual player statistics—the IPL offers an ideal environment for the application of data science and predictive modeling.

The primary objective of this project is to harness this abundance of data from IPL 2025 and convert it into predictive insights that can inform decision-making for teams, analysts, and fans. Specifically, this project aims to evaluate key performance indicators of both teams and players, and to build machine learning models capable of predicting match outcomes based on these indicators.
To accomplish this, four comprehensive datasets were used:

•	matches.csv provides detailed information about each match, including team names, toss results, venue, player of the match, and match winners.
•	deliveries.csv contains granular ball-by-ball data, capturing every delivery bowled, the runs scored, wickets taken, and extras conceded.
•	orange_cap.csv records the top batsmen of the tournament, tracking metrics such as runs, strike rate, boundaries, and consistency.
•	purple_cap.csv includes the top bowlers, detailing their wicket tally, economy rates, and match impact.

By integrating these datasets, the project constructs derived features such as powerplay strike rates, death-over economy, boundary percentage, and performance under pressure. These variables are then used to train machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Additionally, this study explores the strategic impact of decisions like batting first vs chasing, toss outcomes, and venue-specific advantages. It also provides insights into how consistent performers (Orange Cap and Purple Cap holders) influence match results.

The broader goal of the project is to demonstrate the applicability of ensemble learning and sports analytics frameworks in professional cricket. In doing so, it lays a foundation for future tools that can aid IPL franchises in selection strategy, performance forecasting, and fan engagement.
This report is structured to provide a detailed walkthrough—from data acquisition and preprocessing, to model development, evaluation, and interpretation—thereby offering a complete perspective on how data can power smarter cricket analytics
